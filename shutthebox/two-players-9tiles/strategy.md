This program calculates the expected number of wins for a given player given their state. It assumes both players are playing optimally from a given position. This program also determines the optimal move given a state and roll. 

This program uses dynamic programming in order to caluate the expected number of wins or determine the optimal move. 

The current state of a player is defined by the current set of open tiles. Recall that a state S_{i} is Markov if and only if
